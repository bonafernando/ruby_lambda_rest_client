# Ruby lambda rest client

## What is this?
This is a very simple example of a lambda function to make rest calls and how to invoke it.

## Why?
It was very usefull for me to learn how to use AWS Lambda so I thought I should share it.

## Lambda function
You can start it by the folder `function` where you'll create a lambda function.
There is another `README.md` file there.

## Lambda invoker
Then you can go to the folder `invoker` where you'll invoke this just created function.
There is another `README.md` file there.

I took me about 4h to understand and run this test with ruby on AWS Lambda.
I hope this can save some time for you.
If it helped you somehow please star it, and fell free to fork and contribute.
